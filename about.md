Hello, Austin Wang here.

This blog is for me to document things I do to become a web application developer.

A little bit about myself:
I want to empower people's lives through technology, creating applications with useful functionality and accessible user experience.
I want to be a front-end web application developer.
With a computer engineering background, I am in the process of learning and applying the technical skills such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails. At the same time, I am also paying attention to UI/UX design.

Background: I have gone through various engineering training in the Electrical and Computer Engineering program at the University of Toronto. I was focusing mainly on hardware in earlier years but was becoming increasingly interested in software development in my final year. With limited time, I was able to learn algorithms and data structures, analyzing and optimizing programs, as well as distributed systems. On the technical side, I was exposed to software craftsmanship during the process of job hunting. My final year android application project and distributed systems labs allowed me to apply and explore writing clean and well structured code, as well as improving my ability in Object Oriented Programming and Java specifically. In addition, I began expanding my technical skills with books such as Code Complete, Growing Object Oriented Software (TDD), and Refactoring.
