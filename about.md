Hello, Austin Wang here.

This blog is for me to document things I do to become a web application developer.

A little bit about myself:
I am a front-end web developer who is passionate about life-empowering and easy-to-use technologies. My focus is on the functional aspect of web applications, as well as intuitive user experience. 

The reason why I chose to specialize in front-end web development is because the web is the least intimidating and most accessible medium for software applications. With just an internet browser, people can easily utilize various tools and services according to their needs. With rigorous training in computer engineering, I have obtained strong problem solving skills, the ability to adapt to new technologies quickly, and a wide knowledge of software. These strengths allow me to not only work with different languages and frameworks but also work on different types of applications.
